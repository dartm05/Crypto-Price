# Future Improvements for the Crypto Dashboard

## Enhancing Error Handling
While the current implementation includes a centralized error modal, a more robust error-handling strategy could improve user experience. Implementing retry mechanisms for failed requests and logging errors for analysis could help identify and resolve issues more effectively.

## Implementing Data Caching
To optimize API requests and reduce redundant calls, integrating caching mechanisms such as IndexedDB, local storage, or React Query would improve performance and enhance offline support.

## Improving UI and UX
The UI is functional but could benefit from additional styling improvements, animations, and a dark mode toggle to enhance the overall user experience. Accessibility improvements should also be considered.

## Expanding Search and Filtering Capabilities
The search bar currently allows filtering by name. Adding sorting options and advanced filtering, such as filtering by market cap or price range, would provide a more comprehensive user experience.

## Introducing WebSockets for Real-Time Updates
Instead of relying on periodic API polling, integrating WebSockets could provide real-time price updates with lower latency and improved efficiency.

## Supporting Multiple Currencies
Currently, prices are displayed in USD. Adding support for different fiat currencies and allowing users to select their preferred currency would make the dashboard more versatile.

## Mobile Optimization
Although responsive, further improvements in mobile usability, such as optimizing touch interactions and performance, could improve the experience for mobile users.
