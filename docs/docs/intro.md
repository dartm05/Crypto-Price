# Project Setup Guide

Welcome to the Crypto Dashboard project! This guide will help you set up the project, integrate with the API, and understand the state management choices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v20.9.0 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Git

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dartm05/Crypto-Price.git
   cd Crypto-Price
   ```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd web-app
npm install
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
